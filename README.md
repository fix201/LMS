# Library Management System

This project was bootstrapped with [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/) and [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Synopsis
This project focuses on the development of a centralized library management system aimed at streamlining library operations, improving inventory management, and enhancing the user experience. The proposed system will automate the cataloging, lending, and user management processes, addressing the issues faced by libraries with multiple branches in managing their collections, tracking lending, and providing efficient services to users. By leveraging a scalable, cloud-based architecture, the Library Management System (LMS) will be designed to adapt to the growing needs of libraries and support various functionalities, such as book cataloging, inventory management, user management, and search capabilities.

## Build Steps
### Step 0 
Install appropriate versions of Java, Maven, Node, NPM, and MariaDB
### Step 1: 
After installing MariaDB youâ€™ll want to set the password for the root user<br/>
```GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on *.* to 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';```<br/><br/>
Or if you have a user and password already set you can go into `lms-core/src/main/resources/application.properties` and change the `spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.password` to your desired username and password

### Step 2: 
run `mvn clean install` on the root folder of the library management system

### Step 3: This project works best when using an ide, but you can also run it from the command line.
#### For the Backend
Change directory to lms-core
`cd lms-core` <br/>
Run springboot application using maven
	`mvn spring-boot:run`


#### For the front end
Open another terminal window
Go to lms-ui `cd lms-ui`<br/>
Start front end application `npm start`
